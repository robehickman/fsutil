Fsutl is a collection of file system utilities, it includes features to ensure files have a given extension, detect changes, create a manifest of files in a directory, detect changes between two manifests creating a diff list, and facility to apply this list of changes to a prior state. This can be used to store changes to a directory's file list over time and rebuild this state from any of the stored diffs. Used by 'Simple http file sync' and 'rrbackup'.
